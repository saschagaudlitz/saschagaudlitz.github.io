I'm a PhD Student in the [Berlin-Oxford IRTG 2544 "Stochastic Analysis in Interaction"](https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/stoch/IRTG/) under the supervision of Markus Rei√ü. My research interests include:
+ Statistical Inference for SPDEs
+ Inverse Problems
+ Stochastic Models in Neuroscience and Biology.

Outside of academics I enjoy playing badminton, representing [SG EBT Berlin](https://ebt-badminton.de/wordpress/).
