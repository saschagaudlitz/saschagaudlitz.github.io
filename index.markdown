I'm a PhD Student in the [Berlin-Oxford IRTG 2544 "Stochastic Analysis in Interaction"](https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/stoch/IRTG/) under the supervision of Markus Rei√ü. My research interests include mathematical statistics and stochastic analysis, in particular I'm focused on
+ Statistical Inference for Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs),
+ Financial Modelling using SPDEs
+ Score-based generative modelling

I am regularly organising reading group on varyious topics in mathematical statistics and machine learning. Get in touch if you want to join!

Outside of academics I enjoy playing badminton, representing [SG EBT Berlin](https://ebt-badminton.de/wordpress/) competitively.
